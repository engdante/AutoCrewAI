*   **Action:** Deploy audit-approved contracts to a testnet (Polygon Sepolia, etc.), then move to Mainnet with limited capital.
*   **Resource:** Dev Team, Tester.
*   **Outcome:** A live, automated bot that manages liquidity in ZK protocols.

### 2.4 Prototyping (Hardware OEM)
*   **Action:** Design and manufacture prototypes of custom hardware wallets for the selected enterprise vertical (e.g., supply chain hardware).
*   **Resource:** Design firm, Prototype shop.
*   **Outcome:** A physical MVP ready for client demos.

### 2.5 Marketing Channel Establishment
*   **Action:** Deploy Landing Page and LinkedIn outreach strategy targeting Enterprise IT Directors and AI Labs.
*   **Resource:** Marketing agency or freelancers.
*   **Strategy:** "Security as a Service" messaging for hardware; "Verified Yield" messaging for DeFi.

## Phase 3: Scaling, Operations, & Optimization (Months 7-12)

### 3.1 Vertical Replication
*   **Action:** Identify a second vertical for data licensing (e.g., Legal Contracts). Replicate the acquisition/processing pipeline.
*   **Resource:** Operations Manager.
*   **Outcome:** Diversified data portfolio, reducing dependency on a single market.

1.  **Ingestion:** Raw data is received from sources.
2.  **Anonymization:** Remove Personally Identifiable Information (PII).
3.  **Tagging:** Categorize by industry, date, and event type.
4.  **Licensing:** Upload to platform (e.g., Hugging Face) or direct pitch to AI labs.
5.  **Verification:** Automated scripts confirm license agreement adherence.

### Workflow 2: Automated Yield Aggregator
1.  **Trigger:** User deposits capital (or LP tokens are added).
2.  **Execution:** Bot reads parameters (AAA stablecoins, ZK protocols) and executes swaps/deploys.
3.  **Monitoring:** Real-time dashboard checks for slippage or protocol failures.
4.  **Reporting:** Monthly automated statements generated for investors.

### Workflow 3: Enterprise Hardware Fulfillment
1.  **Order Receipt:** Enterprise client confirms hardware specs.
