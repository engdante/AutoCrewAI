# User Task for Agents

Generate comprehensive and actionable passive income ideas tailored to create sustainable, long-term wealth growth. The task requires a detailed investigation of diverse investment opportunities spanning traditional markets (stocks, bonds, REITs), digital platforms (dividend stocks, rental income, online businesses), and alternative assets (crypto, collectibles). Each idea must include a thorough analysis of potential return on investment (ROI), required initial capital, ongoing maintenance requirements, and associated risks. The final output should provide a structured roadmap of three to five distinct passive income streams, complete with implementation steps, timeline expectations, and quality standards to ensure the strategies align with specific risk tolerance and capital constraints.
